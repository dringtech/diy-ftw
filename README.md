# DIY Open Data
Tools and techniques for data

This is a repo containing a catalogur of tools that are useful for data exploration, processing and visualisation.
The initial list was generated by a session that I ran at Open Data Camp 9 in Manchester.
The [Google doc with notes and outputs from the session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zY1KZGlpac-rUnfW3pRwncXotmXe4e1FHzo2VECHQ6M/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs)
contains notes captured on the day.
